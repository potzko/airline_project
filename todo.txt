passwords are all sha256, store them at that size on the db

add auth for operations,
add user -> my flights
add buy flight ticket
add search flights from A -> B
add search flights from A -> ... -> B based on (fastest, cheapest) (prob dijkstra algo) 
backend: move from thin sql wrapper to indevidual wrappers for each "class" (already started see folder dbwrappers)
go through files and remove data to a "config.txt", stuff like sql passwords (which I know I left), and links to the db address
do desighn on the front (clone from header.css that I already did)
